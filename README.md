## General info
This project was undertaken to build a grid-based framework (similar to bootstrap) that includes some basic functionality necessary to build a website. The project is relatively open-ended to give us a chance to exercise our creativity and problem-solving skills. This customed framework was also used to build two full-fledged sites to test its responsive specificities. It is created and built by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Jaykowski">Judah Maina</a>.

## Setup & Live Preview
This project is built with the basic web page structures and styling. It is pretty simple to setup. All you have to do is to clone the project into your local machine.<br>

## Inspiration
The inspiration to our built sites are gotten from the <a href="https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/yogalax/"> Yogalax (A yoga website)</a> and <a href="https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/lifeleck/"> Lifeleck (A lifestyle blog)</a>. These websites uses a popular css grid framework (Bootstrap), hence our choice to clone them.
